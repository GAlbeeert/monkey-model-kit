# monkey-model-kit
This project is the first of my suite of usefull (not really ?) apps.

Monkey ModelKit (shortenned in MMK or MKMK/MkMK) is a CLI app supposed to help model kit builders to keep track of their build times and collection price.

You can create Projects, which will keep all your model kit related data such as :

    - the grade of the build (entry to perfect grade for now)
    - Name of the said  model kit
    - Price of the model kit
    - Total time to build the model kit

and create Project time lists that you will be able to modify by adding times manually in the CLI to calculate the Total time.

Have fun building, and keeping track of those good memories !
